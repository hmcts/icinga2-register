These scripts should probably track any updates at source:

https://github.com/t794104/ansible/blob/icinga_service/lib/ansible/modules/monitoring/icinga2_service.py
https://github.com/t794104/ansible/blob/icinga_service/lib/ansible/modules/monitoring/icinga2_host.py

They are not a full part of official ansible yet, so should look at the above
instead of the ansible repo I suppose.
